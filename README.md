## Introduction

This is a fork of Pixelfed Glitch.

Pixelfed is a free and ethical photo sharing platform, powered by ActivityPub federation.

This fork enables you to run a private/restricted instance without federation requiring an account to view and with working user invites.  The official mobile apps are still compatible while remaining restricted.

## Erata

This fork is for my personal use and you are free to use it or take my features and pull them upstream, but I do not have the time or energy to bother upstreaming my changes.  I have taken the liberty to make opiononated changes to the source code which are probably not compatible with upstream.
